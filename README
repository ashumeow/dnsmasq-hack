These are some scripts for dealing with the problem of retaining local
DNS resolution when connecting to a VPN.  We run dnsmasq locally and
use inotify to make sure that our local instance is always the first
entry in resolv.conf.  Changes to resolv.conf are scraped to configure
dnsmasq to dynamically add and remove servers and domains.

To use:
 - Make sure you have inotifywait
 - Using dnsmasq.conf, setup dnsmasq to run at startup
 - Run dnsmask-hack.sh at startup however you wish.
   - It needs to be able to write /etc/resolv.conf
   - An @reboot crontab entry for root works
   - Run from systemd using the included .service file
     (note it assumes you've copied dnsmasq-hack.sh to /root/bin)

The kick script is meant to clear dnsmasq cache, which is often enough
to get things working again when dnsmasq gets confused.
